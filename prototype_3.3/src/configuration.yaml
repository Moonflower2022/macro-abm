## Info

# 1 tick is a week

# things that are not transfered to this file:

# - the values for the mortgage system
# - the values for some of the banking (deposit and loan thresholds)
# - the start times of different actions (such as households paying rent, frims selling goods 
# and paying wages)

# it is important (for now) that the number of households is 
# divisible by the number of small firms (for the sake of distributing them)
