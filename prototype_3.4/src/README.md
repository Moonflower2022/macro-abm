1 tick is a week

education 2 is the highest, 1 is mid, 0 is bad (sometimes in the model lists will be used, and the indexs are just the education tiers)

constant values that are not transfered to `configuration.yaml`:

* the values for the mortgage system

* the values for some of the banking (deposit and loan thresholds)

* the start times of different actions (such as households paying rent, frims selling goods and paying wages)

it is important (for now) that the number of households is divisible by the number of small firms (for the sake of distributing them)
